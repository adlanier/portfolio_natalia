    <p class="coursework">
      Introduction to Robotics (COMP 581) - The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to robotics, with an emphasis on the computational and algorithmic aspects. The course focuses on algorithms that enable robots to effectively make use of sensory information from the environment and purposefully act upon it. Topics covered include the history of robotics, robot kinematics, actuation, sensing, configuration spaces, control, and motion planning. The course also discusses applications to personal assistance, autonomous vehicles, medical surgery, manufacturing, games, and other areas.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Beyond Objects: Programming in the 21st Century (COMP 590) - This advanced programming course explores paradigms and language models that move beyond traditional object-oriented programming. Through a combination of research-driven discussion and hands-on coding, students gain exposure to concurrent computation, functional programming, and emerging software engineering practices. The course includes practical experience with multiple programming languages (SML/NJ, Go, Rust, Erlang, and Elixir) alongside analysis tools and cloud-native design principles. Emphasis is placed on collaborative learning, critical reading of academic literature, and real-world application through team projects and individual assignments.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Foundations of Software Engineering (COMP 550) - Formal specification and verification of programs. Techniques of algorithm analysis. Problem-solving paradigms. Survey of selected algorithms.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Files and Databases (COMP 421) - Placement of data on secondary storage. File organization. Database history, practice, major models, system structure and design.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Foundations of Programming (COMP 301) - Students will learn how to reason about how their code is structured, identify whether a given structure is effective in a given context, and look at ways of organizing units of code that support larger programs. In a nutshell, the primary goal of the course is to equip students with tools and techniques that will help them not only in later courses in the major but also in their careers afterwards.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Discrete Structures (COMP 283) - Introduces discrete structures and the formal mathematics used to establish their properties and those of algorithms that work with them. Develops problem-solving skills through puzzles and applications central to computer science. 
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Systems Fundamentals (COMP 211) - The overarching goal is to bridge the gap between a students' knowledge of a high-level programming language (COMP 110) and computer organization (COMP 311).
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
      Data Structures and Analysis (COMP 210) - This course teaches students how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and large data instances. Rather than learning to use the data structures found in the libraries of programming languages, students will be learning how those libraries are constructed, and why the items that are included in them are there (and why some are excluded).
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
     Introduction to Programming and Data Science (COMP 110) - Introduces students to programming and data science from a computational perspective. With an emphasis on modern applications in society, students gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
    Linear Algebra for Applications (MATH 347) - Algebra of matrices with applications: determinants, solution of linear systems by Gaussian elimination, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and eigenvalues.
    </p>
    <p class="coursework">
    Calculus of Functions of One Variable II  (MATH 232) -  Calculus of the elementary transcendental functions, techniques of integration, indeterminate forms, Taylor's formula, infinite series.
    </p>
     <p class="coursework">
    Calculus of Functions of One Variable I (MATH 231) -  Limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of one variable.

    <p class="coursework">Computer Organization (COMP 311) - Introduction to computer organization and design. Students will be introduced to the conceptual design of a basic microprocessor, along with assembly programming. The course covers the fundamentals of computer hardware design, transistors and logic gates, progressing through basic combinational and sequential components, culminating in the conceptual design CPU.</p> */}
