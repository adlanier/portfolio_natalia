    At Pearson, I collaborate with cross-functional teams in a fast-paced environment to implement

    services. I contribute to live projects across both front-end and back-end stacks, working with

    which gives me hands-on experience in cloud-based product development. I work with Git (Bitbucket) 
    for version control and support continuous integration and deployment pipelines through Jenkins. 
    I also demonstrate proficiency in Salesforce development and prompt engineering, contributing to
