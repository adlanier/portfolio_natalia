      <p>
      Worked with a team of three to design and implement a Bug2 navigation controller on a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot. We integrated an ultrasonic sensor, touch sensor, and gyroscope for basic obstacle detection and wall following. We implemented a proportional (P) controller to manage wall-following behavior and applied differential drive kinematics to estimate the robot's position. We tested the robot in both Webots simulation and on physical hardware, iterating on our approach to improve navigation and handling of obstacles.

      <p>
      Programmed the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot using Python and the Pybricks MicroPython API.
